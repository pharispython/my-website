 FONTS YOU CAN USE:
 fonts.google.com select and download font-family and paste link in head section of html page

 TO FIND ICONS :
 go to flaticon.com
 1em = 16px = 100%
 em is inherited. i.e if parent font-size is 2em and h1 is 5.625em...image becomes much bigger since it inherits from parent...em is dynamic whilst px is static
 rem is root em and ignores parent size... by setting child em relative to parent.
 rem is more reliable

 clear: left, rigt, ... is opposite of float: left, right,...
 float makes text wrap around element...
 float NOT recommended for positioning
